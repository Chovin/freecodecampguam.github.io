Learn the fundamentals of programming and game development through PyGame. Learn how to Build a gaming cabinet with Makerspace and JFK robotics club, and run your PyGame through Raspberry PI 3; complimentary from our sponsors ....

** Day 1 **  

    Introduce ourselves (Coordinators) and the FCCG. Recognise our sponsors and their contributions to the event.  

    Brief the curriculum.  
    Get them started on the curriculum, making simple text-based games like..  
    * number guessing game
    * rock paper scissors
    * maybe hangman

    Demo some simple games that the coordinators programmed.

>Curriculum?...

** Day 2 **  

    Break up into mandatory teams?

    Have the campers think about what they want to do for the final retro game.

    Tell them we are going to be doing a DIY art installment with all our homemade games for charity.
