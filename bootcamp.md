#Retro Games  (January)

![](https://udemy-images.udemy.com/course/750x422/573646_ec31_3.jpg)

#### Learn the fundamentals of programming and game development through PyGame. 
Join us as we dive into retro game development! Friendly competition and prizes, engaging curriculum, and team up to make a game!..
Ages 13+ (how do we say that while not alienating older people? Maybe don't mention the age. Or say Ages 13-99)
(Mention somewhere about getting connected to a growing community / movement to bring technology and software development to Guam?)


** Day 1 **  

    Introduce ourselves (Coordinators) and the FCCG. Recognise our sponsors and their contributions to the event.  

    Brief the curriculum.  
    Get them started on the curriculum, making simple text-based games like..  
    * number guessing game
    * rock paper scissors
    * maybe hangman

    Demo some simple games that the coordinators programmed.

>Curriculum?...

** Day 2 **  

    Break up into mandatory teams?

    Have the campers think about what they want to do for the final retro game.

    Tell them we are going to be doing a DIY art installment with all our homemade games for charity.

    Tell them that if they continue after this the bootcamp that this is something they can work towards.

    Show them one of the completed game cabinets.

>Curriculum?...

** Day 3 **

    Field Trip to Makers Space.

    Introduce them to Tommy and Val + BoHCfE&I

>Curriculum?...

###Notes:  
* Design an instructions diagram for the cabinet (each person gets one).  
    + List of materails Needed for cabinet and electronic components...
    + What goes where, etc....

* Help from Sponsors  

* DIY cabinets will be sold to charity  

    + what charity will the cabinets be going to?
    + should charity cabinets come with Raspberry PI 3 and PyGame that was developed at the Event?

(https://inventwithpython.com/pygame/chapters/)

* Some topics we should probably be familiar/comfortable with before the bootcamp:

* Object Oriented Programming

* A game loop  

* Making rudimentary physics  

* Time and movement - Velocity

* Interacting with graphics libraries  

* Tranformations  

* Understanding placement and movement in the game world  

* Events? (Async?)
* States? Menus, event screens  

* Event loops and Vectors  

#### Misc ideas

* Go through curriculum and distill it
* have slides about fundamental concepts that we go through interactively at set points in time?
    * flow of execution
    * variables
    * conditionals (logic?)
    * loops
    * functions
    * objects?
* recommend / force people to group up to make the projects? Maybe even to go through the curriculum?
* choose some set projects that we can recommend, go through how their structure should be beforehand and define sections that could be delegated to people to help with teamwork? Nudge them that direction when they go through it? ... not sounding like such a great idea anymore.
* Pi/parts as prizes at least.
* have sponsors donate parts (old parts or new) to the game cabinets after the bootcamp and in exchange we put their logos and such on the game cabinet they sponsored?
